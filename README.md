  * **Payment & Trip Type Breakdown:** See how payment methods (Card, Cash, Wallet) and trip times (Day/Night) influence trends.
  * **Vehicle Performance:** A neat grid shows how different car types are performing across all key metrics – with cool color-coding to spot highs and lows\!
  * **Daily Ride Patterns:** Spot the busiest days, quietest times, and even see how holidays or events might affect ride demand.
  * **Location, Location, Location\!**
      * **Hotspots:** Pinpoint the most popular pickup and drop-off points – super useful for driver placement\!
